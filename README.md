  <b> Welcome to verison 0.1 of my site!🥳 </b>
  <h1> Progress is being made! </h1>
  <hr> 
  <h3> Today is Day 45 of 2023. </h3>
  
 
 <hr>
  <p> I will be working on developing this site continuously! 
  My goal is to share my progress and hopefully inspire you 
  to create in your preferred medium! </p>

 <!-- <h1>This is an example of Header 1 text </h1>
  <h2> There are h1 to h6 headers. This is h2. </h2>
  <h3> Did you know that when designing there is text know as 
    <br>lorem ipsum that acts as placeholders for content on websites!
    This is h3.
  </h3>
  <h4> It seems that h4-h6 headers aren't used much. This is h4. </h4>
  <h5> Below you will find an example of lorem impsum text in h6. This is h5. </h5>
  <h6> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, 
   sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.😵‍💫 </h6>
   <strong> Don't be alarmed if you can't read it. 😅 It's not meant to be read.</strong>
   <hr>
   <p> When trying to add spaces or breaks in your text there is a <br> br tag that
  that you can use. The br tag is an example of a <b> void element! </b> <br>
There is no content within it and does not require a closing tag when used.<br>
<u>At least not in HTML 5. </u></p> -->
